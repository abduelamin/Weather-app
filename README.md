# Weather-app

## Introduction

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that provides users with up-to-date weather information for any city around the world. Users can search for a specific city, view the current weather conditions, and check the 5-day weather forecast.

The most important lesson learnt here was the ability to fetch server API's and manipulating the data in a variety of ways to build a functioning weather app.

## Features

- Search by City: Users can enter the name of a city and receive real-time weather updates.

- Search History: The app keeps track of recent searches, allowing users to quickly revisit their favorite locations.

- 5-Day Forecast: Users can plan ahead with a 5-day forecast that includes temperature, wind speed, and humidity.

 ## Technologies Used

HTML: Markup language used for structuring the web page.

CSS: Stylesheet language used for designing the app's layout and appearance.

JavaScript: Programming language used to implement dynamic functionality, fetch weather data, and update the DOM.

Bootstrap: Front-end framework for responsive and mobile-first design.

Day.js: Lightweight JavaScript library for handling dates and times.

OpenWeatherMap API: External API used to retrieve weather information.
